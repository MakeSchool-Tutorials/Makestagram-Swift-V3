During this tutorial you will build a photo sharing app that is similar to the popular app [Instagram](https://instagram.com/). After finishing the *Make School Notes* tutorial you should have a good understanding of the basics of iOS development.

In this tutorial we will touch many advanced iOS development topics including how to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to build a backend for your app.

Here are the most important things you will learn:

- How to implement an email signup and login flow using Firebase Auth
- How to structure and store data using Firebase Realtime Database
- How to capture photos and upload them with Firebase Storage
- How to query and retrieve data from Firebase
- How to architect a complex iOS app
- How to use libraries built by other developers to speed up development

After finishing the tutorial you will have a good understanding of building complex iOS apps that tie into a backend - from there you will be able to move on and create your original iPhone app!
