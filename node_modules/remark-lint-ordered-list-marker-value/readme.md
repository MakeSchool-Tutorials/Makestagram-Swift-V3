# remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value

Warn when the list-item marker values of ordered lists violate a
given style.

Options: `string`, either `'single'`, `'one'`, or `'ordered'`,
default: `'ordered'`.

When set to `'ordered'`, list-item bullets should increment by one,
relative to the starting point.  When set to `'single'`, bullets should
be the same as the relative starting point.  When set to `'one'`, bullets
should always be `1`.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-value
```

`valid.md` is ok:
