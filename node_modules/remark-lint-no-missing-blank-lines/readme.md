This rule can be configured to allow tight list items
without blank lines between their contents through
`exceptTightLists: true` (default: false).

## Install

npm install --save remark-lint-no-missing-blank-lines
```

## Example

When this rule is turned on, the following file
`valid.md` is ok:

```markdown
# Foo

## Bar

- Paragraph

  + List.

Paragraph.
```

When this rule is turned on, the following file
`invalid.md` is **not** ok:

```markdown
# Foo
## Bar

- Paragraph
  + List.

Paragraph.
```

```text
